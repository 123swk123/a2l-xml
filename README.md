# a2l-xml
converts A2L-Files [ASAM, CCP, XCP] to some xml and vice versa 

syntax converting A2L to XML: a2l2xml input.A2L output.XML

syntax convertion XML to A2L: xml2a2l input.XML output.a2l

The generated xml is very basic and maybe errorprone too.

Maybe someone has some usecase for this software.
